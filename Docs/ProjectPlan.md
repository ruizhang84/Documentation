## 1 Introduction
The "TCCart" project aims to develope a payment and rewards system for coffee and tea carts.  The project will be developed for the Android platform.


## 2 Process Description

***2.1 Project Life Cycle***

We have adopted the Unified Process model for our software development process. The life cycles of this project includes four phases Inception, Elaboration(milestone), Construction(release), and Transition(final production release).


***2.2.1 Inception :***

In this phase, we will go from the the idea of the product to the vision of the end product, the Android app TCCart. We will need to delimit the project scope and make the business case for the product presented. 


*Activities Performed:*

We will develop the initial project plan, which shows the phase, iterations, roles roles of the participants, schedule and milestones, etc. We will also make vision document that produce a simplified use-case model. In addition, we will aslo develop a tentative architecture.

- Project plan (initial, this document).

- Vision document (VisionDocument.md).

*Entry Criteria:*

- Software design. Understand the requirements thoroughly by doing brainstorming and
analyzing the requirements to identify and refine (1) classes, (2)   
attributes, (3) operations, and (4) relationships. Perform
requirements feasibility analysis to ensure that the requirements are
testable or not.


*Exit Criteria:*

- Stakeholder concurrence. All the stakeholders must agree on the scope, definition, and cost schedule estimates for the projects.

- Identify the main risks (and the countermeasures) for the project and also produce a initial plan.



***2.2.2 Elaboration***

We will analyze the app design problem to get a better understanding of app development. We will address the most critical use-cases. In addition, we will try to refine the plan of activities.


*Activities Performed:*

We will complete use-case model with all use-cases and actors identified and most case-use descriptions developed. We will also identify supplementary requirements. In design document, we will also define the lower-level design for the system as well as a complete set of test cases. In addition, we may revise the project plan accordingly.

- Use-case model (UseCaseModel.md).

- Supplementary requirements (i.e., requirements that do not fit the use-case model, such as non-functional requirements. ExtraRequirements.md).

- Design document (DesignDocument.md).

- Test plan (without results, TestPlan.md).

- project plan (revised, this document).


*Entry Criteria:*

- Preliminary project plan and vision document.

- Main risks of problem have been indentified.

*Exit Criteria:*

In general, we should check if the the major risks that we have identified have been resolved or at least addressed.

- Project Plan.

- Design Document

- Vision Document

- Use Case Model

- Test Plan without results



***2.2.3 Construction***

In this phase, we will get most of the actual development done. The app should not only be fully developed but also ready for thoroughly tested.

*Activities Performed:*

We will have a a complete set of artifacts that include design documents, code test cases, etc.

- Development. Source code is implemented during this phase as per the design specified in the UML diagram. 

- Quality assurance. Unit testing is performed to test individual pieces of code and to verify whether individual modules are doing what they are intended to do. 

- Traceability matrix will be created to keep track if the requirements are being met.


*Entry Criteria:*

- The project risk/problem has been well analyzed and addressed.

*Exit Criteria:*

- The software is ready to be deployed to user.

- The software has been thorougly tested.

- A complete product, which should be somehow stable and mature. 



***2.2.4 Transition***

I will mainly develop and maintain the Android app according to user's feedback (for example, they may want to see some improvement in the software).

*Activities Performed:*

- Develop and maintain the app.

- Have a new release of the software.

- Provide training and other assistance if necessary.


*Entry Criteria:*

- The software is deployed to user.

*Exit Criteria:*

- The user is satisfied with app.
