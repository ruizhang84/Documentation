## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Our testing strategy will be comprehensive in nature as in order to assure as few defects as possible across a team project with a shortened timeframe - testing will be critical.  

#### 1.1.1 Introduction
The purpose of developing the Android app *TCCart* is to provide a payment and reward managment system in a timely manner to help our contractor's coffee and tea selling bussiness grow. The testing strategey here is a high level presentation of the test approach to be undertaken in relation to the *TCCart*, which will be used as a reference by our Team54 to develop a Test Plan with details of test activities. In particular, our testing will validate and verify the app works to the contractor's requirements and meets their bussiness needs.

#### 1.1.2 Test levels and test type
#####Unit Test Cases
During early development, *each code developer* will write their own trivial *unit test* cases (corresponding to the methods they author) and verify passing unit test cases before a commit is done once a feature has been implemented.  Most of the time, unit test cases will be run more often.

#####Integration & System Test Cases
For integration testing, we adopt "bottom-up" approach to test individual software modules as a group.The *tester* will peform such testing before system testing. The *tester* will also run Manual Test cases created from specifications/requirements that have been written by the whole team, driven by the test lead, in the system testing.

#####Regression Testing
We have rerun the test cases which passed previously to make sure the new changes (for example, a bug fixed) would not affect the code which was tested already.

### 1.2 Test Selection
We will be using a mix of black-box and white-box testing given that individuals will both write/run test cases for their own code as well as for code that they have not authored.  However, we expect system test cases to be more black box driven than the others.
- Black box - systematic partion testing. This invovles identifying independently testable features and their relevant input, deriving test specifications, and creating test cases.
- White box - branch and statement coverage.

Test cases by itself will be selected using a combination of extreme testing (testing the far ends of input, for example) as well as common use cases.  This should allow us to make sure core functionality works while hitting the outliers for corner case issues.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
To constitute a thorough test whose successful execution implies no errors in our app, we adopt the *specification-based* adequacy criteria. Such criterion specifies the required testing in terms of identified features of the specification/requirements, so that a test set is adequate if all the identified features are fully exercised.

We will ensure the *functional coverage* by covering off all the *documented scenaios* that appears in software specifications/requirements. This coverage is to measure the "quality" of our test sets and provide a stopping rule criteria for unit testing. In addtion, we will provide the testing case to suitably covering off the developer code (i.e., *undocumented* things such as boundary conditions)


### 1.4 Bug Tracking

The bugs or enhancement request will be reported in slack (https://omscs-study.slack.com/messages/6300spring16team54/) and documented. Bugs have been tracked in a Spreadsheet- Defect_Tracking.xls.


### 1.5 Technology

Since testing has been done manually no other technology has been used specially.
